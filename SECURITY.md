Security Policy
===============

Supported Versions
------------------

Ghostlight is under active development. We generally provide security fixes on the latest released version and `main`. Older versions may not receive fixes.

Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Ghostlight, please email:

- ayushaggarwal1136@gmail.com

Please include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any relevant logs, configuration, or environment details

We prefer encrypted reports where possible. If you need a public key, open an issue requesting one and we will respond with details.

Coordinated Disclosure
----------------------

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We investigate and assess impact and scope.
- We work with you on a fix and coordinated release timeline.
- We credit reporters in release notes, if desired.

Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities prior to coordinated disclosure unless there is already a public exploit. If user action is required, we will publish remediation guidance in the `README.md` and release notes.

Scope
-----

This policy covers vulnerabilities in:

- The Ghostlight CLI and code in this repository
- Container images published under `ayush1136/ghostlight`
- Documentation that could lead to insecure defaults

Out of scope examples:

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report upstream when appropriate)
- Social engineering or physical attacks
- Denial of service from unrealistic resource constraints

Contact and Updates
-------------------

Security announcements will be made in release notes. For non-sensitive questions, open a GitHub issue.

Thank you for helping keep Ghostlight and its users safe.
